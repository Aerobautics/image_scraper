## image_scraper
Image scraper for Google image search
#Introduction
This application is intended to be an image scraper for Google image search. It will gather images for training a neural network. You put in a key search term, and it downloads the original image from all results provided by the Google image search engine. It should be able to resize images as needed into one specific size or download the images in the original size. The second major function is allowing the user to go through and curate images. This means that it will present the users with all the downloaded images and ask the user if they want to keep it. The user quickly presses y/n (yes/no) and the image is kept and resized or deleted. This should allow the user to go through thousands of images quickly to create a curated collection or database of images.
